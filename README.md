# Timed Coding Quiz

## Description

This timed coding quiz is a great way for coding students like me to practice their coding knowledge and test their skills. Since the functionality is fully set up, I can add more or change out the questions at any time to incorporate new information as it is acquired. It can easily be made longer or more difficult. Also, creating this quiz allowed me to practice valuable coding skills in the making itself! There were many problems I had to solve creatively to take into account various problems as they arose.
